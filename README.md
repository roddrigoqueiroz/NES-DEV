# NES-DEV

The goal of this project is to share my evolution, learning of the NES programming and maybe help someone else in this learning journey. So, to keep everything organized, here's how the project is being divided:

- The folders' names tell what that project does
- Every project has it's own explanation of what it does and a few pictures to demonstrate it
- The .asm source code contains comments explaning certain pieces of code to help me and other people to understand it
- The code I wrote **does not** intend to run on a real NES

To learn how to code in NES assembly, I'm mainly using the [Nerdy Nights seires](https://nerdy-nights.nes.science/#main_tutorial) and reading the [Nesdev wiki](https://www.nesdev.org/wiki/Nesdev_Wiki) to better understand how the NES hardware works.

## Tolls used

In order to do develop the games, I'm using the following tools:

- Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS (wich is not the recommended OS. If you use Windows, it will be easier to configure the setup)
- [FCEUX](https://fceux.com/web/download.html) as NES emulator
- [NESASM](https://github.com/camsaul/nesasm) as assembler
- [Tile Molester](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/109/) as tile editor
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) as text editor

You are free to choose other tools. But, I recommend you to keep the same as the lessons you are taking.

## Tips to learn how to code in NES Assembly

If you are willing to learn how to code in NES using assembly, I highly recomend to use the [Nerdy Nights seires](https://nerdy-nights.nes.science/#main_tutorial) tutorial with the [Nesdev wiki](https://www.nesdev.org/wiki/Nesdev_Wiki), as I said before, and spend some time trying to really understand the code you are studying.

Also, if you speak portuguese, I can't recommend you to watch this two videos enough: 

- [Akita NES 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G80nuEyDN4)
- [Akita NES 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYJ3dvHjeOE)

In them, Fabio Akita explains the basics of the NES system really well. I also advise you to watch those videos in 1x speed and more than once to completely understand what's going on.
